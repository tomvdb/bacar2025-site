The Secunda Radio Club (ZS6SRC) will launch a pico balloon on Friday, 2 August 2025, carrying a 20m band WSPR (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter) tracker, as part of an ambitious year-long celebration of the 100-year centenary of the South African Radio League (SARL).

This balloon is the latest in a planned series of 12 commemorative launches, which began on 24 May 2025 at the Trichardt Model Aircraft Club. Each balloon honors a different figure who played a key role in the history of amateur radio ballooning in South Africa.

The initiative also pays homage to over a decade of BACAR (Balloon Carrying Amateur Radio) missionsâ€”an experimental platform that has excited radio amateurs since its early beginnings.
